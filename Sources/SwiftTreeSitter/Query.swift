     *    that represent the end of an individual predicate. If a pattern has two
     *    predicates, then there will be two steps with this `type` in the array.

 * to start running a given query on a given syntax node. Then, there are
 * two options for consuming the results of the query:
 * 1. Repeatedly call `ts_query_cursor_next_match` to iterate over all of the
 *    the *matches* in the order that they were found. Each match contains the

 *    multiple patterns can match the same set of nodes, one match may contain
 *    captures that appear *before* some of the captures from a previous match.
 * 2. Repeatedly call `ts_query_cursor_next_capture` to iterate over all of the
 *    individual *captures* in the order that they appear. This is useful if
 *    don't care about which pattern matched, and just want a single ordered
 *    sequence of captures.
 *
 * If you don't care about consuming all of the results, you can stop calling
 * `ts_query_cursor_next_match` or `ts_query_cursor_next_capture` at any point.
 *  You can then start executing another query on another node by calling
 *  `ts_query_cursor_exec` again.
